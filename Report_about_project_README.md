Abstract: 

In this report I will be talking about my project developed on Android studio and giving more details about some tools that I have used in order to build this App. The main objective of this report is also to provide more information that helps the users understand the code in a better way, since it could be hard for those who do not have knowledge in Android studio.  

Introduction: 

Android studio is an amazing platform to create App and it has a lot of tools to develop our projects. In this project we were asked to create an App based on some areas of our life, areas such as: Education, hobbies, skills, achievements. This experiment, we should have four activities which will be connected to each other, and in order to connect and open all those activities we need four buttons for each one of them. To achieve my goals, I started to work on the main activity and try to link the first button in the first activity and once it works, I could start the other activities and then connect one by one. In this experiment we could provide what we have learned so far and then put everything that we have learned on this paper. As Android studio Koltin is a very new language for me, I needed to do a lot of research which I will be talking about more bellow, I will be talking more as well about the challenges that I have faced to build this application as well as all the tools and websites that I could find the solutions.  

Procedures: 

In order to achieve my results, I needed to follow some procedures, as mentioned previously, I started developing my front page with four buttons, and then work on my image and the texts to give a little introduction about myself. After that I created my front page, I started to develop the first activity and test it, to make sure if everything was working properly as I wanted. Once I tested the first activity page, I used it as a model for the three next activities which became easier for me to do that. As I started the task, I used: google and YouTube to see some tutorials to learn more about Android studio and how to connect my activities. It was very useful for me, because I could work better on my needs for my projects and add more colors and create, for example buttons with properly shapes. 

Discussion: 

Working at an Android studio was a challenge for me, because I did not know the Kotlin language. In this section I will be talking a little bit more about my process to and how I faced some issues. 

Once I started to work on it, I got some issues with my app, the solution that I found was downloading an App called “IObit uninstaller” so this App helped me uninstall every file that I had on my pc about Android studio, so like this I could start from scratch and then installing again Android studio which worked perfectly on this time. Another issue that I had was creating my “exit” button, because I wanted to do something more interactive so after looking for a solution, I could find on YouTube a video where I could create an exit button that’s asked for the user whether they wanted to stay or turn off the app. In order to create the round buttons, I needed to create a new draw resource file as show below:

Once I created this button and set up the color, I could add it and turn my four front page buttons. 
To do an icon which works as a button I needed to create a home icon button on my Android studio:

Another step that I would like to talk about too was to set up the icons on my buttons. After good research I found a solution as you can see in my code: 
![02 03 2022_20 04 26_REC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90689336/156558237-a4ebeb97-1546-4111-8733-fcacf0efde5e.png)
As you can see, I set up the icon on the left side. 

The hardest thing was sometimes finding the contents in Kotlin language, since most of the tutorials that I found were in java, so sometimes I got some errors in my code. 

Conclusion: 

Learning Android studio is I good experience, especially in Kotlin language, but once we get used to with this language everything seems easier. All tasks carried out on this project were to force and create affinity with this App platform. It’s an Android focused IDE, designed specially for the Android development. It was launched on 16th May 2013, during Google I/O 2013 annual event. Android studio contains all the Android sDK tools to design, test, debug and profile your app. By looking at the development tools and environment, we can its similar to eclispe with the ADT plug-in there are many cool features available in Android Studio which can foster and increase your development productivity. Bellow you can find some links that I used to develop the project and the link for my GitHub project and the video on YouTube that I did for the project.
